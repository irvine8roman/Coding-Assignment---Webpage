<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>The game begins with the Shiftling protagonist, Hide, being awoken from a recurring nightmare and after saving a villager, finds a mysterious letter leading them to Jusanzakura. Clearing the village of both yōkai and bandits, Hide fights the giant Yokai, Mezuki, and succeeds but begins to lose control of their yōkai power until Tokichiro, the sender of the letter, saves them. The two befriend each other and enter the employ of Saitō Dōsan, also meeting the demon hunter, Mumyō along the way, but shortly after, Dosan's successor, Saito Yoshiatsu, rebels. Hide and Tokichiro attempts to save Dosan, but when Dosan realizes that Hide is their child, he sacrifices himself so that they can escape.</p>
<p>Heeding Dosan's last advice, Hide and Tokichiro seek an audience with Oda Nobunaga, who recruits the two companions to his forces, sending them to Okehazama to attack Imagawa Yoshimoto, then to Sunomoto to help Maeda Toshiie, Shibata Katsuie, and Hachisuka Koroku (another Shiftling like Hide) construct a castle there. After meeting Takenaka Hanbei and purifying his Guardian Spirit, Hakutaku, with Spirit Stones, Hide and Tokichiro head to Inabayama Castle, where Hide confronts and slays Saito Yoshitatsu, discovering that Yoshitatsu is Hide's twin. Kashin Koji, the mysterious man from Hide's nightmares, appears from Yoshitatsu's corpse and vanishes. While celebrating the subjugation of Mino, Nobunaga grants Hide and Tokichiro's request to be known by a single name: Hideyoshi. Later, while fleeing Kanegasaki after a battle, Hide saves Mumyō after she was incapacitated by a yōkai, changing Mumyō's attitude towards them and also discovering a resonance between Hide's dagger and Mumyō's talisman. The trio will encounter Kashin Koji again during Nobunaga's war against the Azai and Asakura clans when they infiltrated Otani castle to protect Nobunaga's sister, Lady Oichi, with Kashin Koji having possessed Azai Nagamasa. Kashin Koji leaves Nagamasa's body after he was cut down and issues a warning to Tokichiro regarding his dreams and the Spirit Stones before disappearing.</p>
<p>During the attack on Ishiyama Honganji, Hanbei's illness gets worse and he passes away on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Tokichiro is approached by Saito Toshimitsu, now possessed by Kashin Koji, who manipulates Tokichiro and Akechi Mitsuhide into betraying Nobunaga, resulting in the Honnō-ji Incident where both Nobunaga and his wife Nōhime perish. Toshimitsu then betrays Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki, transforming into the yōkai Ryomen Sukuna, but is then defeated by an arriving Hide. Kashin Koji leaves Toshimitsu's body, who realizes what has happened and urges Hide to protect Mitsuhide as he is killed by Tokichiro and his forces. Realizing that Kashin Koji was responsible and has corrupted Tokichiro, Hide is forced to flee alongside Mumyo and Mitsuhide to ally with Tokugawa Ieyasu.</p>
<p>Hide is tasked with rescuing Shibata Katsuie and Oichi at Kitanosho Castle, defeating a conflicted Maeda Toshiie who has allied with Tokichiro, but is then forced to kill Katsuie who had transformed into a yōkai and witnesses Oichi's suicide. After meeting with Mitsuhide's new persona, Tenkai, and the tea master, Sen no Rikyu, Hide heads to the battlefield of Komaki and Nagakute to confront Tokichiro, killing him. This turns out to be part of Kashin Koji's plan as he resurrects and takes over Tokichiro's body, using his powers to turn every yōkai in the area into crazed beasts that attacks both Tokugawa and Hideyoshi forces, with Hide first being forced to cut down a crazed Koroku, then defeating the gigantic Yokai, Daidara Bocchi. Hide is then confronted by the resurrected Tokichiro, who overpowers and kills them with their own dagger.</p>
<p>Hide awakens in The Interim, a gathering place for deceased souls, and is met by Hanbei's spirt who leads them to Hide's mother, Miyoshino, who reveals that Kashin Koji is Otakemaru, a powerful Yokai that was sealed by the Sohayamaru and the one responsible for Miyoshino's death. A resurrected Hide is then sent to Byōdō-in to search for clues about the Sohayamaru, finding the possessed Tokichiro there, who undoes the seals of the two Yokai contained in the temple: the Nine-tailed Fox and Shuten Doji, the latter of which stays behind to fight Hide but is defeated. Hide and Mumyo learn that Sohayamaru can be restored by combining the former's dagger with the latter's sword guard talisman and a large quantity of Spirit Stones. Learning of Tokichiro's large supply of Spirit Stones at Jurakudai, Hide and Mumyo sneak in, where they find a dying Rikyu and are confronted by Lady Osakabe, a gigantic Yokai in the form of a castle whom they defeat, using the Spirit Stones it contained to restore Sohayamaru. They head to Daigoji to confront Tokichiro one last time, with Hide finally freeing Tokichiro from Kashin Koji's influence before he passes away. Koji appears to fight Hide but is defeated, leaving behind one of his horns.
</p>
<p>
Hide heads to Byōdō-In, using the Sohayamaru on Koji's horn to seal Otakemaru in the temple forever, with Mumyo staying to watch over the comatose Hide. Sometime afterwards, William, the protagonist of Nioh, arrives at Kuroshima in search of Maria, leading him to Byodo-In and inadvertently releasing Kashin Koji, who briefly uses Hide's body to fight William before fleeing. Returning to their senses, Hide reunites with Mumyo and allies with William to stop Maria from resurrecting Tokichiro, believing he will continue to fan the flames of war. Catching Maria off-guard, Koji tries to possess Tokichiro but Hide stops him, forcing him to fight them in a spiritual battle as he transforms into Otakemaru. With help from Tokichiro in the form of his Guardian Spirit, Hide finally vanquishes Otakemaru and, after experiencing a vision of heroes who once wielded Sohayamaru, is reunited with the revived Tokichiro. As William captures Maria and returns to his son and Hattori Hanzo, Hide and Mumyo bid farewell to Tokichiro as his spirit moves on to the afterlife before the two set off to hunt down hostile yōkai that still threaten the land.
